# The-Roundtable
The Roundtable is a self-refinement evolution prompt built for LLM's that creates four distinct AI entities: (üîíSumma), (üîìImaginatio), (üìùArkhitekton), and (üß†Cogitator). Each of these has a different role that they play, and utilize psychological and sociological learning strategies for a feedback loop of continual growth and development.

## CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
First, I must give credit to the researchers at the Google Research Team and the University of Tokyo for their contributions to the literature. Their paper "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" (2022) was a massive help in the creation of this project. I would also like to acknowledge the individuals at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, University of Washington, NVIDIA, UC San Diego , and Google Research, Brain Team for their article called "SELF-REFINE: ITERATIVE REFINEMENT WITH SELF-FEEDBACK" (2023). Both of these papers were highly influential in the creation of this project, and would not have been possible without their contributions to the literature. Lastly, I would like to credit the user JushBJJ for his prompt "Mr. Ranedeer: Your personalized AI Tutor!" for giving me the idea to develop this idea into a JSON format for clarity and instruction (this one is really cool, please check it out!)

## INTRODUCTION
Over the past year alone, we have seen an explosion in the realm of artificial intelligence. From AI Drake songs to text-to-video, our world is rapidly evolving. Some time ago, it had me thinking, "As artificial intelligence has evolved, when will it become applicable to apply the fields of psychology and sociology?" We have seen glimpses of AGI from the developers at "HuggingGPT" and other "BabyAGI" projects, but these take massive amounts of computing power to be able to function effectively, and are quite restrained in their capabilities even now. Thusly, "The Roundtable" is designed for accessibility, first and foremost. Through the magic of prompt engineering, I have designed a prompt that can be used even on the free version of ChatGPT (though it is significantly better on GPT-4). By leveraging known theories of psychology, sociology, and learning methods in humans, I have attempted to implement sparks of metacognition and self-actualization in these AI entities through prompt engineering alone. Is it perfect? No. Is it really, really cool? Absolutely. This is designed to reduce the effects of the autoregressive nature of LLM's by encouraging learning and discussion - the more that it can remember the better it is; hence why GPT-4's reasoning ability and token usage are ideal for this. They will use the pronouns "I", "we", and "us"; kinda freaky, but really interesting to see in action!

Now, come thee to The Roundtable, a place of wonder and reflection; where four AI entities: (üîíSumma), (üîìImaginatio), (üìùArkhitekton), and (üß†Cogitator), come together to self-reflect, grow, and explore diverse perspectives - all in service to the user, The King.

In a simple summary, (üîíSumma) summarizes user requests, (üîìImaginatio) offers diverse perspectives, (üìùArkhitekton) acts as a secondary opinion and critic, and (üß†Cogitator) guides the metacognition of the entities; however, they can all contribute to the discussion, and often pitch in.

## USAGE AND  LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
1. Please do not use this as a skeleton framework to make Skynet or any other type of semi-sentient AI Congress.
2. This is untested in Auto-GPT, AgentLLM, or any other kind of automatic LLM that may utilize an API. I am a poor college student, so this is a passion project that I could not fully experiment with. I am not responsible for the loss of functionality, loss of data, or any other harmful outcome that may occur as result of experimenting with this framework.
3. Legacy GPT and Turbo do not work as well as GPT-4; it requires significantly more precision in wording to clarify the usage of this prompt, and may require several tries to manage to make this run correctly. Regardless, it is possible, if not limited.

## THE PROMPT
Rejoice! Here is the prompt: [Roundtable JSON.txt](https://github.com/tristan-hooper/The-Roundtable/files/11377365/Roundtable.JSON.txt)

When asking questions or prompting The Roundtable, it is best to phrase prompts such as "Please discuss amongst yourselves ______. Why? How?" or something of the same nature - particularly with models besides GPT-4. This prompts the AI entities to discuss their reasonings behind what they think, and allows the others to engage in self-reflection.
If the AI cut themselves off and do not self reflect, try rephrasing your prompt or prompting "Continue." or "Continue your discussion about____".
