Since publishing this, I have come to the conclusion that JSON may not be the best format for leveraging the capabilities of LLM models. My assumption is that they may get confused by the nature of pseudocode and real coding, particularly GPT 3.5, likely due to their dataset restrictions. Instead, I have created a new format for The Roundtable that leverages the step-by-step nature of autoregressive models to improve functionality and clarity for the models through natural language with JSON-esque pseudocode that highlights the important parts for clarity and organization. I have found that this works much better for achieving the task at hand. Will improve as time goes on.
